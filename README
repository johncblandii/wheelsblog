This is a sample app to showcase the functionality in CFWheels. It is a very simple app and isn't in anyway meant to be seen as a real blog.

This app will grow as time goes on but for now it is showcasing Ajax functionality with Wheels.

Notes:
* Download, deploy /source somewhere [mine is http://wheelsblog.local], setup cf datasource [named 'wheelsblog'], and run /database/wheelsblog.sql script on it
* Fill your db (manually) with dummy data (so you can see something)
* Go to [domain]/blog/posts
* Click on a blog post title
